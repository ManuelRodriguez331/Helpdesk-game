  new Speech(270,"agent->customer","Sure. On a scale from poor until super-helpfull, what is your judgement?",[271]),

  new Speech(281,"supervisor->agent","You think, it's the monitor itself?",[282]),

  new Speech(312,"agent->customer","Are you using a Windows computer?",[313]),
  new Speech(313,"customer->agent","Sure, can you hurry a bit?",[314]),
  new Speech(314,"agent->customer","Sorry, but the problem description wasn't detailed enough. I will close the ticket. Do you like to attend the customer poll?",[315]),
